            Developed a novel system predicting early Parkinson's using
            Handwriting, Voice, and gait data. Hosted a mobile app with JS and
            Flask API to collect regular data. Utilized transfer learning with
            VGG16 feature extraction, achieving a 98% accuracy in a multi-modal
            pipeline for predicting early Parkinson's.

            Segmented a 20 million customer base into 30+ clusters using usage
            patterns, demographics, and features. Gathered 36-month campaign
            details from Snowflake databases. Established an environment, built
            an agent, and designed a reward system for offline Q-learning
            training. Evaluated model performance with hyperparameter-tuned
            models. Integrated model outcomes into the delivery pipeline,
